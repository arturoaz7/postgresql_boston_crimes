# PostgreSQL Boston Crimes
Through this project we build a Database to store data related with crimes ocurred in Boston. The dataset is available in a file named boston.csv in this repository.
In the notebook we learned and put some skills into practice such as:

  - How to create a database and manage database roles.
  - How to create database schemas and tables with the proper datatypes.
  - How to load data from CSV files into database tables.

# PostgreSQL Boston Crimes
Through this project we build a Database to store data related with crimes ocurred in Boston. The dataset is available in a file named boston.csv in this repository.
In the notebook we:

  - Create a PostgreSQL database and manage database roles.
  - Create database schemas and tables with the proper datatypes.
  - Load data from CSV files into database tables.
